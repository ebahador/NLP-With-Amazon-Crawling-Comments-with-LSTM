# Review_Rating_prediction_with-crawling_Amazon_data
The primary purpose of the following project is to predict the rates of comments submitted by people who purchased the item on Amazon. Five different famous classifiers do the projects to test and measure the classifiers' accuracy when they face actual, live data. The models are designed to process the text as the matrix of features, and the targets are rates in the range of one to five.

The classifications are done by five different popular classifiers with Sk-Learn and PyTorch:

•	Gaussian Naïve Bayes

•	Support Vector Machine

•	Long-Short Time Memory (LSTM)

•	K-Nearest Neighbors

•	Random Forest
